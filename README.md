1.Problem Statement
The rise of fake news on social media and online platforms threatens public trust, influences politicalOpinions, and can cause significant societal harm. This project aims to develop an advanced fake News detection system powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, capable of Automatically classifying news articles or posts as ‘fake’ or ‘real’.

2. Objectives of the Project

- Build an intelligent system to classify news as fake or real.
- Apply advanced NLP techniques to detect hidden patterns.
- Train machine learning models for prediction.
- Contribute to limiting the spread of misinformation.

3.Scope of the Project

Features:
- Text pre-processing and feature extraction.
- Build and evaluate ML models.
- Provide model explainability.
Limitations:
- English-language news articles only.
- Real-time classification as future work.
